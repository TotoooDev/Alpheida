## What is Alpheida?

Alpheida is a small game created to be compatible with as much platforms as possible.

The engine (the Shrimp Engine) of the game aims at being the most platform independant possible, and having the least dependencies poossible.

## Compatible platforms

The Shrimp Engine is currently compatible with these platforms :

- Linux
- Nintendo Switch (homebrew)
- Wii (homebrew) **WIP: no sound, no inputs, textures are broken, and only tested on an emulator**

More platforms are on their way!

## Playing the game

First, you will need to build the game yourself, since Alpheida is not yet on homebrew appstores.

You can learn how to build the game by following the [build tutorial](BUILD.md).

## Creating a game with the Shrimp Engine

Comming soon... (although if you look at the structure of the code it should not be difficult to figure out how to isolate the Shrimp Engine from the rest of the game lol).
